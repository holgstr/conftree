# <span style="color:#F55431;">**`conftree`**</span>: Subgroups With Trees Using Conformal Prediction

This `R` package detects homogeneous subgroups in machine learning models with numeric outcomes (regression). It leverages [CV+/Jackknife+][1] to simultaneously optimize inter-group heterogeneity and intra-group homogeneity. In this way, it is an extension of the `r2p` algorithm ([Lee et. al, NeurIPS 2020][2]). `conftree` works with any of the [100+][3] learning algorithms for regression tasks available in `tidymodels`.

## Installation

You can install the current development version from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
if (!require("remotes")) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("holgstr/conftree")
```

## Quickstart

Let's find subgroups in the Washington bike share data. We use `tidymodels` to set a random forest as `learner`, a 5% miscoverage rate as `alpha`, and 10-fold CV+ to quantify the uncertainty in the resulting subgroups:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(conftree)
library(tidymodels)
data(bikes)

set.seed(1234)

# Specify the learner to be used for model training:
randforest <- rand_forest(trees = 200, min_n = 5) %>%
  set_mode("regression") %>%
  set_engine("ranger")

# Find optimal subgroups:
groups <- r2p(
  data = bikes,
  target = "count",
  learner = randforest,
  cv_folds = 10,
  alpha = 0.05,
  gamma = 0.2,
  lambda = 0.5
)

# Display tree structure:
groups$tree
```
