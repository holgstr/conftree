Description: Detect subgroups in machine learning models with numeric outcomes (regression). This leverages CV+/Jackknife+ to simultaneously optimize inter-group heterogeneity and intra-group homogeneity. In this way, it is an extension of the r2p algorithm, see Lee et al. (2020) <arXiv:2006.07917v2>. This works with any of the learning algorithms for regression tasks available in 'tidymodels'.
